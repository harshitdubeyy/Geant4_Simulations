# Geant4_Simulations of CLYC detector response for Neutrons and Gamma rays 

CLYC Detector: CLYC (Cs2LiYCl6) is a unique scintillator material that has gained attention due to its ability to detect gamma rays and neutrons simultaneously. This dual capability makes it ideal for various applications, such as in the fields of nuclear physics, medical imaging, and astrophysics.

Geant4: Geant4 is a software toolkit designed and developed by CERN to simulate the passage of particles through matter. It utilises the Monte Carlo simulation process to do so. The functioning of Geant4 relies on C++ macros, which allow for the creation and manipulation of complex geometries and materials.
